== Overview

The JMS bridge provides statistics about messages that have been processed through the bridge:

* number of messages successfully committed
* number of messages aborted

The goal of this RFE is to display these statistics in the runtime section of the management console.

== Requirements

The runtime section of the console adds a column to show statistics for JMS bridges.

Current columns: Runtime / <Server> / Messaging / <Messaging Server>
New Columns: Runtime / <Server> / Messaging / JMS Bridge / <JMS Bridge>

When selecting a JMS bridge the statistics for

* Message Count
* Aborted Message Count

are displayed in the preview section.

=== Affected UI

* Runtime / <Server> / Messaging

=== Affected Resources

* `/subsystem=messaging-activemq/jms-bridge=*`

== Test Plan

New tests will be added to verify that the preview of a JMS bridge in the runtime section shows the statistics for

* Message Count
* Aborted Message Count
