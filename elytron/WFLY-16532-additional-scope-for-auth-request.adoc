== Overview

OpenID Connect is an authentication mechanism that builds on OAuth 2.0 
and allows a user to login to a web application using credentials established 
by an OpenID provider. 
Currently, when sending an authentication request to the OpenID provider, one 
of the required parameters with the authentication code flow is "scope". However, for 
now, the Elytron OIDC HTTP authentication mechanism hardcodes this value to just "openid" and only allows additional scopes to be specified via a "scope" query parameter.

The https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest[OpenID Connect specification] indicate that there are other scope values which may be included in 
the authentication request. This new feature will add the ability to configure the `scope` attribute
of the `elytron-oidc-client` subsystem under the `secure-server` and `secure-deployment` resources, so that additional scope values can be specified when 
configuring the server or the deployment settings. 

The feature will allow the user to specify additional scope values in two ways: 

* In an application's `oidc.json` configuration file in the `WEB-INF` directory of the application,

* Adding configurations to the `elytron-oidc-client` subsystem under the `secure-deployment` and the 'secure-server' resource.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* A new attribute named `scope` will be added to the `secure-deployment` and the `secure-server` resources under the `elytron-oidc-client` subsystem, which will be used 
to specify additional scope values. The user can specify the scope values in either resource when setting up the other attributes, such as, `client-id` and `provider-url`. These values will be used by the Elytron HTTP OIDC authentication mechanism.  

* It must be possible to configure this attribute using cli commands. For example: 

```
    /subsystem=elytron-oidc-client/secure-deployment=my-secure-deployment:write-attribute(name=scope, value="profile offline_access")
```

* It must also be configured by specifying it in the deployment. This can be done using the `oidc.json` file inside the `WEB-INF` directory. For example: 

```
    "scope" : "profile email offline_access"
```

* The OpenID Connect Specifications contain more details on https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims[optional scope values] and https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#OfflineAccess[using scope values to requst Offline Access.]

* The scope value must be a String of space separated values as seen in the examples above. 

* When building the redirect URL, the scopes are to be added at the end as `&scope=openid+profile+email+offline_access` with the `+` as the delimiters replacing the spaces. 

* Although OpenID Connect has a small set of scope values outlined in the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims[documentation], there are additional scope values that can be configured depending on the OpenID provider. The scope attribute must accept additional scope values accepted by different OpenID providers. 

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Backwards Compatibility

N/A

=== Default Configuration

The `scope` attribute would be undefined by default and in that case, the scope value
would be hardcoded as `scope=openid` as before if the user does not configure any additional scope values. 

== Test Plan

* WildFly Elytron test suite: Integration test cases implemented to test for functionality. 

* WildFly test suite: Ensuring the correct scope is specified in the authentication request and used when the `scope` attribute is changed. The token will be checked for the correct claims obtained using the scope values configured.

* Tests will be added for both subsystem and deployment configuration. 

* Tests may be added to ensure that the subsystem configuration would fail if the stability level is not defined appropriately. 

== Community Documentation

Documentation for the new scope option will be added to https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/main/docs/src/main/asciidoc/_admin-guide/subsystem-configuration/Elytron_OIDC_Client.adoc[Elytron OpenID Connect Client Subsystem Configuration].
