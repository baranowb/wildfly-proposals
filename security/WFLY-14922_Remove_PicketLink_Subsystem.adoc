== Overview

The PicketLink subsystem in WildFly has been deprecated for quite some time now. Related to this,
setting up SSO with SAML using PicketLink is also deprecated. In order to configure SSO
with SAML for WildFly, the
https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/#jboss-eap-wildfly-adapter-2[Keycloak SAML Elytron adapter]
can be used instead.

This task is focussed on the removal of this subsystem from WildFly and the related migration path
for configuring SSO with SAML for WildFly.

As a removal RFE, this does not require new feature test development. However both teams will need
to review existing testsuites for tests dependent on the PicketLink subsystem. Identified tests will
either need to be deleted or they will need to be converted to use the new approach.

=== Affected Projects or Components

* WildFly
* Keycloak

=== Other Interested Projects

* [x] External Testsuites

* [x] Quickstarts

=== Relevant Installation Types

* [x] Traditional standalone server (unzipped or provisioned by Galleon)

* [x] Managed domain

* [x] OpenShift s2i

* [x] Bootable jar

== Requirements

Since this is a removal task, this section will describe the steps that will be needed as opposed to the
set of requirements.

=== Hard Requirements

* The PicketLink subsystem needs to be converted to a model-only legacy subsystem. A model-only
legacy subsystem is only supported either in admin-only mode to facilitate migration or in domain mode
where a current domain controller can manage legacy hosts so that older domains can still be managed.
If a standalone server is started with the PicketLink subsystem present in the configuration without
admin-only mode, an error will occur.

* Any affected tests will need to be removed from WildFly.

* Any documentation that references PicketLink will need to be removed. The main section in the WildFly documentation
that is affected is the "WS-Trust and STS section".

* The `org.keycloak.keycloak-saml-wildfly-elytron-adapter` module that's installed by the Keycloak SAML Elytron
adapter will need to be updated to remove the `org.picketbox` module from its dependencies (the `org.picketbox` dependency
does not appear to be used, it just needs to be removed). See https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/11553[Issue #11553].

* The Keycloak adapter's CLI script will need to be updated to work properly with WildFly now that Elytron is used by
default. See https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/11552[PR #111552].

* A simple migration operation will be added to the `picketlink-federation` subsystem to allow migrating a default
(i.e., empty) configuration to `keycloak-saml`. The migration operation will assume that the user has already installed
the Keycloak SAML Elytron adapter (either manually or using the Galleon feature pack).

* Documentation will be created to explain how a user can migrate non-empy `picketlink-federation` configuration
to `keycloak-saml`.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

N/A

=== Non-Requirements

* Automatically migrating non-empty `picketlink-federation` subsystem configuration is not a requirement. The `picketlink-federation`
migration operation will fail if a user attempts to migrate non-empty configuration. The user will need to follow the steps outlined
in the migration documentation instead.

* A Galleon feature pack will be added to install the Keycloak SAML Elytron adapter as part of a separate RFE
(see https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-16306[WFLY-16306]).

* The migration documentation won't cover PicketLink STS in detail. Apache CXF STS has already been an alternative to
PicketLink STS. Users can reference existing documentation on Apache CXF STS instead. (If more details are needed,
we'll need to ask the Web Services team to look into this.)

== Implementation Plan

N/A

== Test Plan

To be discussed.

The Keycloak SAML Elytron adapter already exists and is already used and tested today. Testing will
be needed to make sure no issues arise after removing the `org.picketbox` module dependency
from the `org.keycloak.keycloak-saml-wildfly-elytron-adapter` module.

== Community Documentation

In addition to removing any references to PicketLink from the community documentation,
a "migration" article will be added to indicate that the Keycloak SAML Elytron adapter
should be used to configure SSO with SAML for WildFly. Users should refer to the Keycloak
documentation for more detailed information.

== Release Note Content

The PicketLink subsystem has now been removed from WildFly. Please refer to
https://docs.wildfly.org/25/Migration_Guide.html#Migration_PicketLink for information on
how to use the Keycloak SAML Elytron adapter to configure SSO with SAML for WildFly.
