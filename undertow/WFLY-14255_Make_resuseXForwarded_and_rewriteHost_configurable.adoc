== Overview

In some scenarios it is a requirement to reuse x forwarded or rewrite host header. Currently ProxyHandler flags controlling both are hardcoded to 'false', meaning mentioned functionality is not accessible.
This RFE adress this by introduction of model values that control mentioned flags.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Being able to configure both flags via model:
   - reuse-x-forwarded-header
   - rewrite-host-header

[literal]
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:undertow:14.0" default-server="some-server" default-servlet-container="myContainer" default-virtual-host="default-virtual-host" instance-id="some-id" statistics-enabled="true">
    ....
        <handlers>
            <file case-sensitive="false" directory-listing="true" follow-symlink="true" name="welcome-content" path="${jboss.home.dir}" safe-symlink-paths="/path/to/folder /second/path"/>
            <reverse-proxy ... reuse-x-forwarded-header="true" rewrite-host-header="false">
            </reverse-proxy>
        </handlers>
    ....
</subsystem>
Parameters will be present in reverse-proxy element(for standalone: /subsystem=undertow/configuration=handler/reverse-proxy=my-handler):
* reuse-x-forwarded-header
** Default: false
** Type: boolean
** Description: if true append(reuse existing) remote hop to x-forwarded-* headers, if not, previous value is discarded and remote hop becomes the value, otherwise set it to remote host.
* rewrite-host-header
** Default: false
** Type: boolean
** Description: if true set host header to connection remote end and create x-forwarded-host header.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Backwards Compatibility

Subsystem transformers should be able to handle it.

=== Default Configuration

No change.

=== Importing Existing Configuration

No steps, transformers should handle purging default value for previous configs.


=== Deployments

No. Default is still false for both, so there should be no change in behavior.

=== Interoperability

Not affected.

== Security Considerations

////
Identification if any security implications that may need to be considered with this feature
or a confirmation that there are no security implications to consider.
////

== Test Plan

== Community Documentation
 
Should be part of model reference. Possibly could be documented in Undertow as well?
 
== Release Note Content
