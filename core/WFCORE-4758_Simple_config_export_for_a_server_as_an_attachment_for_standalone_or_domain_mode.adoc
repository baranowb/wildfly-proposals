== Requirements

Provide a management operation to export the configuration of a running server as an XML data stream to avoid content being escaped. This operation should replace the existing '*read-config-as-xml*' operation without the escaping issues.
It should work for a standalone server as for a domain server.

=== Hard Requirements

 * Export the current running configuration as an XML data stream that can be saved or displayed with the attachment operation from the CLI.
 * Since the full configuration is read, the operation should fail if the user is not in a role that allows reading sensitive data.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Implementation Plan
Simple usage:
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] :read-config-as-xml-file
{
"outcome" => "success",
"result" => {"uuid" => "89c858bf-dba4-4d38-8b8c-93e13beaacca"},
"response-headers" => {"attached-streams" => [{
"uuid" => "89c858bf-dba4-4d38-8b8c-93e13beaacca",
"mime-type" => "application/xml"
}]}
}
----

To display the content of the file:
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] attachment display --operation=:read-config-as-xml-file
ATTACHMENT 3363018e-1a79-401a-a865-97d85c83f5f4:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
...

Delete if not needed. The intent is if you have a complex feature which can 
not be delivered all in one go to suggest the strategy. If your feature falls 
into this category, please mention the Release Coordinators on the pull 
request so they are aware.

== Test Plan

* Add a test "testReadConfigAsXmlFile" into the class `org.wildfly.core.test.standalone.mgmt.api.CoreServerTestCase` in the standalone testsuite to check that the result of the operation is the same as the "standalone.xml" file used to start the server.

* Add several tests to the class `org.jboss.as.test.integration.domain.ManagementReadXmlTestCase` in the domain testsuite:
    ** testDomainReadConfigAsXml : check that the result of the operation is the same as the "domain-standard.xml" file used to start the server.
    ** testHostReadConfigAsXml : check that the result of the operation is the same as the "host-master.xml" and "host-slave.xml" files used to start the hosts.
* Add a test to the class `org.jboss.as.test.integration.mgmt.access.StandardRolesBasicTestCase` in the rbac testsuite:
    ** readWholeConfigAsXMLFile

== Community Documentation

* Covered by operation description in management model.

== Release Note Content

A new operation to export the effective configuration of a server as an XML file.
