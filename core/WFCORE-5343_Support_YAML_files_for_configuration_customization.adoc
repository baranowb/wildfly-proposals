== Overview

The aim of this proposal is to be able to inject external configuration in a YAML format to WildFly in order to customize an existing configuration.
It is out of the scope of this proposal to provide support to define a complete server configuration in YAML: as such you won't be able to add a new extension using a YAML file.
We also want this to be *idempotent*: that means that starting and restarting the server with the same command line should produce the same result and shouldn't fail.
This feature is expected to be used by users of full WildFly installation.
Also given that the YAML files are used to cusomize an XML configuration, they are expected to work on the current server implementation.
This feature might interfere with the support for CLI script on boot as those configuration changes will be applied before the CLI boot scripts so the server might not be fully configured at that time (like for example in WildFly s2i images).

== Requirements

WildFly will be able to take a list of YAML files from the command line to redefine its exisiting configuration.

The operations will be applied in the order the files are defined and after the initial operations defined by the XML configuration.
The YAML configuration should be *idempotent* so that we can start and restart with the same command line without failure nor resulting with a different final configuration.
The YAML structure should follow the management model structure, the YAML tree should match the management model resource tree.

We may use YAML local tags to support operations syntax.
So at boot, WildFly will load and parse its XML configuration, then add all the required extensions. It will then parse the YAML files, looking for a `wildfly-configuration` element as root for the configuration updates.

For each entry, it will check if the resource is already created by the XML, otherwise it will add a new operation to the list of boot operations to add the required resource.
If the resource already exists then it will add a new operation to the list of boot operations to update the attributes.

If we support more operations (like delete) then we will update the current list of operation to reflect that. This means that if an attribute is updated in a YAML file, then the resource is deleted in a second one then the first operation won't be executed.

This feature differs from what was done in https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-5324[WFCORE-5324] because while we are customizing the configuration, the result is not persisted.
Please note that the scripts would be applied after the YAML files so those changes might be done on a server that is not in its final configuration state (like for example in WildFly s2i images). In order to address that, if we detect that we are running in admin-mode with cli scripts to be applied we won't apply the YAML changes until the reload.
The changes are applied on boot and not after an initial boot, and thus don't require a *reload*, thus we should have better performance.
Also we don't provide the logic semantic that you have with the Jboss CLI scripts but on the other hand since we don't persist the resulting configuration you can reuse the same command and you don't have to check for pre-existing resources.

=== Hard Requirements

* Support for multiple files.
External files will take precedence over the XML configuration ones. Then order will follow the command line: 
- If the resource doesn't already exist: add the resource with all the specified attributes of the YAML section.
- If the resource is already defined then all we have to do is update its attributes using the `write-attribute` operation.
- If the YAML part defines an empty resource and the resource already exists: log a WARNING, otherwise try to add it.
- If the YAML is incorrect: like defining an non-existing attribute or child resource we should fail.

* Undefine attribute: using a YAML tag !undefine. For example:
----
wildfly-configuration:
    subsystem:
        logging:
          console-handler:
            CONSOLE: 
              named-formatter: COLOR_PATTERN
              level: !undefine
----
Using a null value is not 'doable' as we have attribute where the 'null' value is significant. This is the proper way to 'remove' an attribute value.

* Allow setting null if a value is empty and the attribute is null-significant.
* Allow support to remove resources using a YAML tag !remove. For example:
----
wildfly-configuration:
    subsystem:
        microprofile-jwt-smallrye: !remove
----
The remove operation would remove all the resource children related operations. Thus removing a subsystem will ensure that any operation related to a resource of said subsystem won't be applied at all during the boot, even those defined beforehand. Of course if the resource is defined afterwards it will get added again.
Note that the `!remove` operation is only for resources and not for attributes. If you want to 'remove' an attribute the proper way is to `!undefine` it.


* Allow support for adding elements to list and supporting indexes.
A YAML sequence of the elements to be added is expected.
----
  permission-set:
    default-permissions: 
      permissions: !list-add 
        - class-name: org.wildfly.transaction.client.RemoteTransactionPermission
          module: org.wildfly.transaction.client
          target-name: "*"
          index: 0
----
* Paths can be absolute, relative to the current execution directory or relative to the standalone configuration directory.
* Support *unmanaged* deployments as those don't have an impact on anything except the configuration. 
* Managed deployments are not supported and any description of such a deployment must fail.
* Allow to define a size limit for YAML files using `-Dorg.wildfly.configuration.extension.yaml.codepoint.limit=`.

=== Non-Requirements

The goal of the YAML files is to be able to customize an existing configuration. It is not here to replace the existing configuration support with XML. As such we won't support part of the management model.

Only those elements would be *supported*:

- core-service
- interface
- socket-binding-group
- subsystem
- system-property
- deployment: to add *unmanaged* deployments to the server.

That means that at least those entries would be *ignored*:

 - extension: to add extension to the server as this might require modules which can be missing.
 - deployment: to add *managed* deployments to the server as this requires more than just some configuration.
 - deployment-overlay: to add deployment-overlays to the server as this requires more than just some configuration.
 - path: since those should already have been defined when the YAML files are parsed.
 
As this configuration extension is for a *standalone server* only this *won't be supported in domain mode*.

Because we need to support expressions, it might be complex to get a JSON schema describing the YAML files for IDE completion. Also such a schema would be really big and would be really difficult to maintain or verify.

While the YAML configuration files aim to be able to be resused across versions, it depends mostly on the evolution of the configuration meta model which is out of the scope of this initial proposition.
If an attribute or a resource changes across version are such that the YAML extension can't find it (like a resource moving in the tree or an attribute being removed or renamed) then the YAML configuration will become stale and will have to be updated accordingly.
*So the feature doesn't aim to be retro-compatible*. We might provide a tool to migrate the YAML configuration files in the future.

== Implementation Plan

If we are processing YAML files then the server is in *read-only* mode: that makes idempotence easy to achieve. We could persist the resulting configuration after boot so that we wouldn't be in read-only mode but then what is the purpose of the YAML files after the 1st execution ?
We are going to process the YAML files to get a list of operations to be applied at boot after the operations defined in the XML configuration file. That means that when we are processing the YAML files we don't have access to the model that was persisted in the XML configuration file.
What we are going to do is use the boot operations to define what to do with what is described in the YAML files.

In the YAML tree we can check if the node is matching a resource or an attribute.
If it is a resource then we check if there are boot operations for this address, if such is the case then we have to process the attributes, otherwise that means that we need to create the resource.
To create a resource we will look into the YAML subtree for the attributes that are defined, and add an `add` operation for it.

If the resource is created then we look for its attributes that are writable in the YAML subtree and add a `write-attribute` operation for each of them. That means that we need to have every element in a list since we are not using `list-add` in this case.

Then we process the sub-resources if any exist.

We should be able to get the effective XML file (using the `read-config-as-xml` operation) to validate the result of our YAML configuration.

In order to behave properly with boot cli scripts, if we detect that we are running in admin mode with cli scripts to be applied we won't apply the YAML changes until the reload.

Managed deployments are not supported and any description of such a deployment must fail.
The deployment description must follow the resource definition, this means that we must have a `content` key with a list of values (even if in practice only the first value will be used).
Sample description of a correct deployment:
----
wildfly-configuration:
    deployment:
        test.jar:
            content:
                - 
                    path: test.jar
                    relative-to: jboss.server.base.dir
                    archive: true
        hello.jar:
            content:
                - 
                    path: test.jar
                    relative-to: jboss.server.base.dir
                    archive: true
----

But such a description must fail:
----
wildfly-configuration:
    deployment:
        test.jar:
            content:
                - 
                    path: test.jar
                    relative-to: jboss.server.base.dir
                    archive: true
        hello.jar:
            content:
                -
                    empty: true
----

Note that any failure will cause the boot to fail, thus this description will fail with an IllegalArgumentException describing the failure.

== Test Plan

org.jboss.as.test.manualmode.management.persistence.yaml.YamlExtensionTestCase in the manual test suite holds most of the testing:

 * YamlExtensionTestCase#testNoYaml: `-y`, no yaml file(s) defined
 * YamlExtensionTestCase#testSimpleYaml: checking thata single yaml file is properly applied.
 * YamlExtensionTestCase#testAttributeOverrideByTwoYamlFiles: checking that multiple yaml files are properly applied.
 * YamlExtensionTestCase#testSimpleYaml#testAddingResourceWithOverridingAttributesByTwoYamlFiles: checking that removing then adding a resource works.
 * YamlExtensionTestCase#testYamlOperations: test the proper behaviour of the tags `!undefine`, `!remove` and `!list-add`).
 * YamlExtensionTestCase#testUndefineNonExistentAttributeYamlOperations checks that you can't undefined something that doesn't exist.
 * YamlExtensionTestCase#testListAddOperationToStringFails: test that adding a wrong type element fails.
 * YamlExtensionTestCase#testListAddOperationToNonExistentResourceFails: test that adding an elemnt to a unexisting attribute fails.
 * YamlExtensionTestCase#testReplacingResourceByEmptyResourceLogsWarning: test tha adding an empty resource via YAML logs a warning.
 * YamlExtensionTestCase#testSimpleYamlWithReload checks that the YAML changes are not persisted.
 * YamlExtensionTestCase#testSimpleYamlWithCliBootOps: checks that YAML and cli scripts are working properly together.
 * YamlExtensionTestCase#testSimpleYaml#testDeploymentYaml: checks that adding unmanaged deployments via YAML works.
 * YamlExtensionTestCasetestServerStartFailedForManagedDeployment: checks that managed deployments can't be added via YAML.
 * YamlExtensionTestCase#testAddingExtensionPathDeploymentOverlayYamlLogsWarnings: checks that path, extension and deployment-overlay can't be added via YAML.
