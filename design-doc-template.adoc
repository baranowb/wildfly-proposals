=== Hard Requirements

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements
// Requirements in this section do not have to be met to merge the proposed functionality.

// the work covered by this proposal should be moved to the 'Future Work' section.


=== Non-Requirements

// but which are not required.

=== Future Work
// Use this section to discuss requirements that are not addressed by this proposal
// but which may be addressed in later proposals.

== Backwards Compatibility

// versions of WildFly?
// Can the identified incompatibility be avoided?

=== Default Configuration

=== Importing Existing Configuration

=== Deployments

=== Interoperability

//== Implementation Plan
////
Delete if not needed. The intent is if you have a complex feature which can 
not be delivered all in one go to suggest the strategy. If your feature falls 
into this category, please mention the Release Coordinators on the pull 
request so they are aware.
////

== Admin Clients

////
Identify the level of compatibility this feature will have with the existing
admin clients (JBoss CLI and the Admin Console / HAL).

Identify any follow up work that will be required in the clients and link issues
created to track this work.
////

== Security Considerations

////
Identification if any security implications that may need to be considered with this feature
or a confirmation that there are no security implications to consider.
////

== Test Plan

== Community Documentation
////
Generally a feature should have documentation as part of the PR to wildfly main, or as a follow up PR if the feature is in wildfly-core. In some cases though the documentation belongs more in a component, or does not need any documentation. Indicate which of these will happen.
////
== Release Note Content
////
Draft verbiage for up to a few sentences on the feature for inclusion in the
Release Note blog article for the release that first includes this feature. 
Example article: http://wildfly.org/news/2018/08/30/WildFly14-Final-Released/.
This content will be edited, so there is no need to make it perfect or discuss
what release it appears in.  "See Overview" is acceptable if the overview is
suitable. For simple features best covered as an item in a bullet-point list 
of features containing a few words on each, use "Bullet point: <The few words>"
