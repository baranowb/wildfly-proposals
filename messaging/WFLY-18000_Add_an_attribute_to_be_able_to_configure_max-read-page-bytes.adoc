== Overview

In order to avoid OutOfMemoryException, Apache Artemis has defined an upper limit for paging. This limit is controller though the *max-read-page-bytes* which is not exposed not configureable from WildFly.
So we are adding a new `max-read-page-bytes` attribute to be able to set that value.

max-read-page-messages and max-read-page-bytes are used to control messaging reading from paged file into the Queue. The broker will add messages on the Queue until either max-read-page-meessages or max-read-page-bytes reaches the limit.

If both values are set to -1 the broker will keep reading messages as long as the consumer is reaching for more messages. However this would keep the broker unprotected from consumers allocating huge transactions or consumers that don't have flow control enabled.

== Requirements

Add a new `max-read-page-bytes`attribute to the https://docs.wildfly.org/28/wildscribe/subsystem/messaging-activemq/server/address-setting/[/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server/address-setting resource] to define the paging memory size.

=== Hard Requirements

Create the attribute to be able to configure the Artemis broker.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Backwards Compatibility

// Does this enhancement affect backwards compatibility with previously released
// versions of WildFly?
// Can the identified incompatibility be avoided?

=== Default Configuration

=== Importing Existing Configuration

=== Deployments

=== Interoperability

== Implementation Plan

* Add a positive INT `max-read-page-bytes` attribute, with a default value set to `-1` in bytes. It is not required.

This attribute will be added to the https://docs.wildfly.org/28/wildscribe/subsystem/messaging-activemq/server/address-setting/[/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server/address-setting resource]

== Security Considerations

== Test Plan

* Changes in Wildfly management model will be covered in WF testsuite.

== Community Documentation

* Covered by attribute description in management model.
