== Overview

When moving messages from the server scaling down, all the operation is done in a single transaction which means that all the messages need to be in memory and can lead to a OOME. The purpose of this feature is to enable the size of the transaction (aka the number of messages) to be defined so that messages are moved by blocks instead of a single block.

=== User Stories

As an administrator I want to be able to scale down a node in my cluster when the load is decreasing and configuring the number of messages to be moved  in a batch.

=== Other Interested Projects

=== Relevant Installation Types

* Traditional standalone server (unzipped or provisioned by Galleon)
* Managed domain
* OpenShift Source-to-Image (S2I)
* Bootable jar

== Requirements

* Add an optional `scale-down-commit-interval` integer to the  https://docs.wildfly.org/35/wildscribe/subsystem/messaging-activemq/server/ha-policy=replication-colocated/configuration=secondary/index.html[/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server/ha-policy=replication-colocated/configuration=secondary] to control the size of the messages transaction block.
* Add an optional `scale-down-commit-interval` integer to the  https://docs.wildfly.org/35/wildscribe/subsystem/messaging-activemq/server/ha-policy=shared-store-colocated/configuration=secondary/index.html[/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server/ha-policy=shared-store-colocated/configuration=secondary] to control the size of the messages transaction block.
* Add an optional `scale-down-commit-interval` integer to the  https://docs.wildfly.org/35/wildscribe/subsystem/messaging-activemq/server/ha-policy=shared-store-secondary/index.html[/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server/ha-policy=shared-store-secondary] to control the size of the messages transaction block.
* Add an optional `scale-down-commit-interval` integer to the  https://docs.wildfly.org/35/wildscribe/subsystem/messaging-activemq/server/ha-policy/live-only/index.html[/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server/ha-policy=shared-store-secondary] to control the size of the messages transaction block.

Those attributes should have a default value of "-1" and any negative value should be converted to that.

== Test Plan

* Verify changes in Wildfly management model:
** verify that `scale-down-commit-interval` value is read from XML configuration file,
** verify that the attribute is rejected when transforming to older schema version.
* Manual tests: use the reproducer described in https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-19752
* Integration tests:
In the Messaging QE test suite adding a test to simulate the reproducer:  org.jboss.qa.artemis.test.cluster.LiveOnlyScaleDownTestCase.


== Community Documentation

* Attribute description in the Wildfly management model:
"The batch size for committing the messages being moved on scale down."

Otherwise no community documentation is needed.


== Release Note Content

Added the `scale-down-commit-interval` attribute on the ha-policy to be able to define the number of messages in a transaction batch when transferring them to another node during a scale down .
