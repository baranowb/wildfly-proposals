== Overview

Standalone default configurations are wildly used. These configurations allow to start using WildFly without having to customize the server.

Today standalone configurations, due to the Galleon internal structure they are based on, require that a complete installation of the server be installed
to be usable. They are not benefiting from Galleon trimming capabilities that tooling based on Galleon offers.

Tuning a default configuration to add/remove subsystems is a complex task (mainly due to capability dependencies checks). 

So today, standalone configurations are hard to customize and require a full server to be usable. Although being generated using Galleon they are
not benefiting from Galleon full capabilities, such as:

* Ability to reduce the server installation size and number of binary artifacts. 
* Ability to easily add/remove subsystems (and dependencies).

We are here proposing to partially solve these issues by changing the internal Galleon structure they depend on.

Galleon Layers feature has been introduced in Galleon in order to solve this kind of issues. 
But until now, the standalone default configurations have not been benefiting from it.

We plan to handle this RFE in 2 iterations. 

* A first iteration (this WFLY-16863) that targets WF28 that would re-implement default standalone configuration using the set of existing Galleon layers.
 Such refactoring should be treated as an implementation detail that doesn't require community documentation, examples, ...
This iteration would put in place the basic blocks allowing to expand on it. Nevertheless, ability to trim down the size of a valid standalone config 
should be made possible.

* A second iteration (TBD) that would target WF TBD that would focus on trimming and tuning standalone default configurations 
to include/exclude Galleon layers in/from a default configuration.

== Requirements

The 3 feature-packs defined in the wildfly source repository: `wildfly-ee-galleon-pack`, `wildfly-galleon-pack` and `wildfly-preview-feature-pack` 
must have their standalone default configurations expressed with Galleon Layers.

We are here re-implementing the following standalone default configs with Galleon layers:

* standalone.xml
* standalone-ha.xml
* standalone-full.xml
* standalone-full-ha.xml

We are not expecting the default configurations to be 100% expressed with Galleon layers. 
Some configuration adjustments can be operated outside of Galleon layers (eg: in feature-group). 
Nevertheless, all subsystems are provisioned by Galleon layers. This means that the required JBoss Modules modules for the subsystems are provisioned. 
Only some subsystem configuration adjustment would be applied to the configuration.  Such adjustment should not imply the provisioning of extra 
JBoss Modules modules.

NB: If it appears that some JBoss Modules modules not provisioned by Galleon layers would make sence for a 
default standalone config, such modules would be explicitely included in the default configs that require them. This analysis has been made in 
the chapter 'Not provisioned JBoss Modules analysis'.

=== Hard Requirements

==== Backward compatibility

* Default standalone configurations should be semantically identical (or with clearly explained differences) to WF 27 standalone default configurations.

==== Observed differences with WF27 default configurations

These changes apply to both standalone default configurations and example configurations.

* `jberet` subsystem `security-domain` attribute is set to `ApplicationDomain`.
* The order of some list of resources is different. For example, in elytron subsystem: permissions, security-domains, sasl and http factories orders are different. 
In infinispan subsystem, the order of cache-container is different.

==== Not provisioned JBoss Modules analysis

The analysis has been made for JBoss Modules modules that are not provisioned. 
The data can be found https://gist.github.com/jfdenise/c1dab1bf8451335f6cd936d22f20538a[there]:

[QUESTION] Some JBoss Modules modules could be expected to be provisioned with default configs:

* modules/system/layers/base/org/apache/activemq/artemis/protocol/* [optional artemis protocols]
* modules/system/layers/base/org/eclipse/persistence [jipijapa-eclipselink-jakarta]
* modules/system/layers/base/org/hornetq/client [org.wildfly.extension.messaging-activemq, legacy connection factory resource]
* modules/system/layers/base/org/wildfly/security/jakarta/client/resteasy|webservices [SPIs from RESTEasy or JBoss WS but no integration point]

==== Observed differences with WF27 example configurations

The example config standalone-minimalistic.xml now contains access-control and audit-log. 
With the existence of Galleon layers this configuration is perhaps meaningless.

==== Implementation notes

===== Internal aggregators Galleon layers

In order to help remove duplication and allow for simple extension of standalone configurations between wildfly-ee-galleon-pack and wildfly-galleon-pack,
we are introducing 2 internal (an internal Galleon layer is not expected to be used directly to provision a server) Galleon layers aggregators:

* `internal-standalone-profile`: Aggregate all Galleon layers that would form the base for the standalone.xml and base for the standalone-ha.xml . In addition 
to Galleon Layers that build-up the configuration, 2 layers that only bring JBoss Modules modules are included: `web-console` and `hibernate-search`.

[source,xml]

    <layer name="embedded-activemq" optional="true"/>
    <layer name="iiop-openjdk" optional="true"/>
</dependencies>
----

These Galleon layers are defined in `wildfly-ee-galleon-pack` (and currently redefined in `wildfly-preview-feature-pack`).

===== Changes to existing Galleon layers

Some changes will be applied to some existing Galleon layers to reduce the configuration adjustments done in default standalone configurations.

This proposal would bring the following changes:

* `remoting` Galleon layer. Unset the endpoint worker `default` value. This would make the worker attribute to rely on its default value that is `default`.
* `ejb` Galleon layer. Make dependency on `messaging-activemq` optional.


===== Default configs defined in wildfly-ee-galleon-pack are inherited by wildfly-galleon-pack

There is no re-definition of configurations in `wildfly-galleon-pack`. The configs are inherited from its dependency on `wildfly-ee-galleon-pack`.
In order for `wildfly-galleon-pack` to include some microprofile related configuration items, the `internal-standalone-profile` 
Galleon layer is redefined in `wildfly-galleon-pack` to include microprofile content.

===== Default configs defined in wildfly-preview-feature-pack are fully redefined

The wildfly-preview-galleon-pack currently fully redefine the default configurations , `internal-standalone-profile` layer 
and `internal-standalone-full-profile` layer. 

===== EE Standalone default configurations included Galleon Layers adjustments

These adjustments are subject to evolve according to what changes can be done during WF28 life cycle. 
They are the one that would be required for WF 27.

* standalone.xml
** Include `undertow-default-config` feature-group. Doesn't depend on extra JBoss Modules modules. 
** Include `infinispan-local-server` feature-group. Doesn't depend on extra JBoss Modules modules. 
** Unset `subsystem.ejb3` feature `default-resource-adapter-name` and `default-mdb-instance-pool` attributes.

* standalone-ha.xml
** Include `undertow-default-config` feature-group
** Unset `subsystem.ejb3` feature `default-resource-adapter-name` and `default-mdb-instance-pool` attributes.

* standalone-full.xml
** Include `undertow-default-config` feature-group. Doesn't depend on extra JBoss Modules modules. 
** Include `infinispan-local-server` feature-group. Doesn't depend on extra JBoss Modules modules. 
** Include `subsystem.ejb3.service.iiop` feature. Doesn't depend on extra JBoss Modules modules. 

* standalone-full-ha.xml
** Include `undertow-default-config` feature-group. Doesn't depend on extra JBoss Modules modules. 
** Include `messaging-activemq-ha` feature-group. Doesn't depend on extra JBoss Modules modules. 

====== Full Standalone default configurations adjustments

In addition to the adjustments done in wildfly-ee-galleon-pack, 
the WF27 existing adjustments to handle microprofile are done in all default configurations:

* Include `microprofile-jwt` Galleon layer
* Include `microprofile-opentracing` Galleon layer
* Include `microprofile-opentracing-jaeger` feature-group. Doesn't depend on extra JBoss Modules modules. 

====== Preview Standalone default configurations adjustments

In addition to the adjustments done in wildfly-ee-galleon-pack, 
the WF27 existing adjustments to handle microprofile are done in all default configurations:

* Include `microprofile-jwt` Galleon layer
* Include `microprofile-opentracing` Galleon layer
* Include `micrometer` Galleon layer
* Include `microprofile-opentracing-jaeger` feature-group. Doesn't depend on extra JBoss Modules modules. 

===== Standalone HA adaptation of Galleon layers

This adaptation is in charge to exclude any local configuration and include distributed ones. 
This is done in standalone-ha.xml and standalone-full-ha.xml config files:

* Exclusion of `jpa`, inclusion of `jpa-distributed`      
* Exclusion of `ejb-local-cache`, inclusion of `ejb-dist-cache`
* Exclusion of `web-passivation`, inclusion of `web-clustering`

===== Misc

* All un-used Galleon feature-groups are removed.
* Example configurations are partially expressed with layers to avoid to duplicate configuration content.

==== Security considerations

The generated default standalone configurations are at least as secured as the WF 27 ones. 
We are observing that the jberet subsystem will become secure using an elytron security domain (that the layer configures).

==== Galleon Provisioning

Using Galleon CLI, Galleon maven-plugin, Bootable JAR maven-plugin and WildFly maven-plugin, one need to define a provisioning.xml file that would be consumed 
by the Maven plugin.

Here is an example of a Galleon provisioning.xml file. A trimmed default standalone.xml configuration is provisioned.

[source,xml]
----
<installation xmlns="urn:jboss:galleon:provisioning:3.0">
    <feature-pack location="wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):current">
        <default-configs inherit="false">
            <include model="standalone" name="standalone.xml"/> [1]
        </default-configs>
        <packages inherit="false"/> [2]
    </feature-pack>
    <options>
        <option name="optional-packages" value="passive+"/> [3]
    </options>
</installation>
----

Annotated XML items:

* [1] standalone.xml is a default config that we want to see included in the provisioning.
* [2] All packages are not provisioned, just use the set of required one.
* [3] Configure Galleon to just provision the set of required JBoss Modules modules.

==== Some numbers

* Full server: 280MB
* standalone-full-ha.xml:  201MB
* standalone-full.xml:  201MB
* standalone-ha.xml:  190MB
* standalone.xml:  189MB


==== Impact on quickstarts 

* NONE

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* NONE

=== Non-Requirements

* Documenting the set of layers that compose a default standalone configuration is out of scope.
* Documenting the internal Galleon layers us out of scope.
* Domain default configurations are out of scope.
* Ability to exclude Galleon layers from a default config is out of scope.
* Example configurations in docs, although redefined partially with Galleon layers, don't benefit from trimming capabilities. 
An effort would be needed to introduce Galleon Layers that are specific to these default configurations (eg: xts, rts, ...). 


== Test Plan

* Add new tests to cover trimmed standalone configurations execution.

== Community Documentation

* NONE

== Release Note Content

* NONE
