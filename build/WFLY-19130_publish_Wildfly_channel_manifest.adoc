== Overview

https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-channel[Wildfly-channels] added ability to create channels defining component versions used to provision WildFly.
This ability is being used in component testing and by provisioning projects like Galleon plugins and Prospero.

This proposal describes how the WildFly manifests should be published at build time.

=== Channels overview

A channel consists of a manifest and a set of artifact repositories. The manifest itself is an YAML file either deployed in one of the channel's repositories
or referenced via an URL. This discussion will focus only on the former option.

A manifest published in an an artifact repository, can be referenced using one of two options - either using a full Maven GAV, or as a stream of manifests,
using just the GA part of the Maven coordinates.
When using a full GAV of a manifest, the channel will always retrieve artifact versions associated with this version. On the other hand, when using only a GA,
the channel will try to resolve the latest available version of the manifest, therefore providing the latest available components. The later scenario is used
by provisioning tools like Prospero to provide updates for provisioned servers.

If the channel is required to provide backwards compatibility guarantee, this should be enforced using either groupId or artifactId naming convention. 
For example, if a project provides two concurrent versions (e.g. 1.2.x and 2.0.x), and wants to provide independent updates to both, it could create two
separate channels `org.test:project-1.2` and `org.test:project-2.0`.

On the other hand, if the channel wants to simply provide access to the latest project state, it can create a single manifest stream with coordinates like
`org.test:project`. In this case, the newly published manifest might contain a non-backwards compatible upgrade (e.g. from version `1.2` to `2.0`).

The actual versions that the manifest is published with are not relevant, as long as they are incremental. However, if the manifest is tied to a project 
release (i.e. it can only be updated by releasing a new version of the project), using the same versions as the project will make it easier for the
users to find correct manifest versions.

== Requirements

WildFly project currently creates three feature packs: `wildfly-ee`, `wildfly` and `wildfly-preview`.
Those feature packs can require different versions of the same component being provisioned. To provide this flexibility each
feature packs has to have a separate channel associated with it.

A channel consists of a stream of manifests with the current manifest being determined by its Maven version. When a new version
of WildFly is published a new manifest with the same version as WildFly release will be added to the channel.
The backwards compatibility of a channel is achieved through a naming convention where the supported version range is added to the 
artifactId of the manifest (e.g. `org.wildfly:wildfly-32.0`).

For this proposal we will publish the latest manifest with no backwards compatibility guarantee, meaning each channel will always
contain components of the latest released version of WildFly.

Following three channels will be created as part of this proposal:

[cols=3]
|===
| Manifest GA
| Artifacts
| Depends on

|`org.wildfly.channels:wildfly-ee`
|wildfly-ee and its dependencies
| -

|`org.wildfly.channels:wildfly`
| wildfly and its dependencies
|`org.wildfly.channels:wildfly-ee`

|`org.wildfly.channels:wildfly-preview`
| wildfly-preview and its dependencies
| -

=== Manifest metadata Requirements

The manifest file defines a few metadata fields:
* name - human readable name of the manifest. Should contain the version of the server.
* id - identifier of the manifest used to resolve manifest dependencies. Should be the same as the GA of the manifest.
* description - human readable description of the manifest.
* requires - id and optionally maven coordinates of dependency manifests.

=== Hard Requirements

* WildFly manifests are published in Maven repository during release.
* Provisioning tools using wildfly-channels can use the published manifest to provision and update WildFly server.
* Different WildFly features packs created in the project are able to use different versions of the same artifacts.
* The versions of the manifests correspond to WildFly releases. When using version `32.0.0.Final`, the user should 
receive manifest for WildFly 32.0.0 Final

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements


=== Non-Requirements
* The WildFly channels do not guarantee backwards compatibility.
* Using the WildFly channels to perform a major version upgrade is possible, but not supported.
* Publishing a channel definition (channel.yaml file)

== Backwards Compatibility

Publishing the manifests adds new capability for provisioning and testing tools, but doesn't affect existing features.

== Community Documentation

Update Prospero documentation and examples with provisioning WildFly server using published manifests.

Add an example of provisioning WildFly server using a channel to https://docs.wildfly.org/wildfly-maven-plugin/releases/4.2/provision-example.html[wildfly-maven-plugin documentation].
